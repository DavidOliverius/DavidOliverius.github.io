                    <p>Working for years in television as an Assistant Editor has given me the opportunity to be a part
                        of many exciting projects over my career. Always with an eye to improve the process and think of
                        a more efficient workflow, I’ve learnt how to efficiently manage all the data that comes with
                        large television programs, from the start of production all the way through to the delivery of
                        final episodes. </p>

                    <p>In my most recent role as<em> Supervising Technical Producer</em> on <em>The Real Housewives of
                            Melbourne</em>, it
                        was my responsibility to oversee the ‘rushes’ on the show from the day it was shot - data
                        wrangling and verifying the processing of the footage, organising the footage and syncing all
                        audio/video, then passing it onto teams of editors and post-producers to put the episodes
                        together.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic everybody was working from home so we used Avid on Demand
                        and edited every episode in the cloud. Every member of the team had their own VM hosted on
                        Microsoft Azure servers which was booted up every morning while I managed the uploading of all
                        the footage so scenes could be shot on one day and cut the next.</p>

                    <p>Finally, when episodes were
                        completed it was my job meticulously go through every episode and connect the low-resolution
                        edit with the original high-resolution footage in <em>DaVinci Resolve</em>, before it was
                        delivered to a
                        Post-Production house for colour grading and delivery.</p>

                    <p> Some of the <a href="img/resume.pdf" target="_blank">other projects</a> I've worked on are shows
                        such as <em>Grand Designs Australia</em> and
                        <em>Masterchef Australia</em>.</p>

                <div>

                    <p>After almost 10 years experience as an Assistant Editor, I have become very proficient in two of
                        the most powerful pieces of software in post production - <em>Avid Media Composer</em> and
                        <em>DaVinci
                            Resolve</em>. </p>

                    <p><em>Avid Media Composer</em> is the de facto NLE
                        (non-linear editor) around the world and is used extensively throughout Hollywood. It is the
                        only
                        editing software able to support large teams working on projects together, and I have extensive
                        experience in setting up those environments for large teams of editors and post producers.</p>

                    <p><em>DaVinci Resolve</em> has taken over the Colour Grading space within video and is the
                        industry standard for 'finishing' projects. Developed in Melbourne by <em>BlackMagic
                            Design</em>,
                        you would be hard pressed to find any television series or film being released without having
                        gone through Resolve first.</p>
