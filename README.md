## Purpose
Beginning this project was a small step in my career but a giant leap in my confidence. It allowed me to dive in and really get my hands dirty building a website from scratch - with many hours of tinkering - which resulted in creating something I am incredibly proud of. I now have a personal portfolio which I can add to over time as my skills grow and I complete new projects.
## Functionality / Features
Foremost in my mind when building this website was getting to grips with Flexbox and letting it do as much work as possible, having a responsive design that will work for any user on any device. It also has a welcoming and calming aesthetic with lots of negative space and a minimal design.
#### Clear Sections
Using ample padding I created clear sections that I could place information in with distinctive coloured backgrounds, utilsing Flexbox to organise the content within.
#### Blog Posts
A Web 2.0 inspired blog post component is used extensively throughout the site as both a preview for the blogs on the home page, and the blog pages themselves surrounded by images. Using media queries and Flexbox, these dynamically move around the page depending on the users device and screen size.
#### Footer
The footer is used throughout all pages of the site as a nice bookmark to the aesthetic, but more importantly as an easy way for anyone to get in contact with me, with self-explanatory icons indicating links to my LinkedIn and Github profiles, as well as my email address.
## Target Audience
The website is designed to appeal to potential employeers in my goal to be hired in the future as a Junior Web Dev. I hope it showcases technical skill and some of my personality.
